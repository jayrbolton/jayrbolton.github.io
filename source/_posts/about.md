I'm a software developer in Berkeley, CA. My main interests are in computational biology & frontend engineering. I like to think about the ratio of effectiveness to complexity, the relationship of syntax and semantics, the gap between subject and object, and snacks.

I built this site using [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and modified the [apollo](https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo) theme.

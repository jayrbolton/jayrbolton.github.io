## [Rally Starter](https://rallystarter.com)

A platform for organizing activism around different causes. I'm doing full-stack development for this project in a small team.

## Meshy - secure and decentralized collaboration

## [CommitChange](https://commitchange.com)

[CommitChange](https://commitchange.com) is a fundraising platform for nonprofits. I helped start it as its CTO in the summer of 2013, when we packed everything we owned into a single car and drove to the Bay Area to join a startup incubator, beginning the long and strange journey of building a tech startup in "silicon valley". We raised funds from people like Mark Cuban, Tim Draper, and 500 Startups. I cut my teeth on programming and Javascript while working on CommitChange, directly after finishing undergrad CS.

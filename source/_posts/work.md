# CommitChange

[CommitChange](https://commitchange.com) is a fundraising platform for nonprofits. In the summer of 2013, [Roderick Campbell](http://twitter.com/siliconroderick) and I packed everything we owned into a single car and drove to Silicon Valley to join the [BoostVC](http://boost.vc/) incubator and begin the long and strange journey of building a tech startup in the bay. We are now located in Oakland. I have been doing full stack development in Javascript and Ruby for CommitChange as my primary focus for the last few years.

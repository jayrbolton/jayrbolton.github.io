## [CommitChange](https://commitchange.com)

[CommitChange](https://commitchange.com) is a fundraising platform for nonprofits. I helped start it in the summer of 2013, when we packed everything we owned into a single car and drove to the Bay Area to join a startup incubator, beginning the long and strange journey of building a tech startup in "silicon valley". I cut my teeth on programming and Javascript while working on CommitChange.

#### [flimflam - a functional, modular, reactive, tested web components](http://flimflamjs.github.io)

Flimflam is a core development interest for me, and I hope to soon have a very robust and complete collection of UI components in this system: [Link](http://flimflamjs.github.io)

#### [dontdie - runway calculator](http://www.jayrbolton.com/dontdie)

Get a general idea about the feasibility of a startup that collects monthly recurring revenue by entering some of your basic metrics and getting a three-year projection. Made using the Functional Frontend Architecture I use, described below. [Link](http://www.jayrbolton.com/dontdie.)

#### [Elementary Cellular Automata](http://www.jayrbolton.com/elementary_cellular_automata/)

A small elementary cellular automata simulator in javascript using canvas and functional reactive programming. Given the opportunity, I'd like to generalize this into a [self-referencing cellular automata](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/alife14/978-0-262-32621-6-ch083.pdf).

#### [ffffocus](http://www.jayrbolton.com/ffffocus)

This is a micro-app that I use for my own work. It helps me focus like crazy. It's like the Pomodoro Technique, but instead is goal oriented. [Repo](github.com/jayrbolton/ffffocus).

#### [vexpad](http://www.jayrbolton.com/code-compose/)

Write sheet music in your browser using code. [Link.](http://www.jayrbolton.com/code-compose/)

This one is still a work in progress, but I'm excited to expand it further: server-side persistence, allow for ABC notation, Grand Staff rendering, printer and mobile support, and other things.

#### [Linear Partitioning](https://github.com/jayrbolton/linear-partitioning)

An algorithm useful for image collage libraries and other things. [Link.](https://github.com/jayrbolton/linear-partitioning)

#### [Python Type Inference](https://github.com/jayrbolton/python-type-inferencer)

Undergraduate project for statically analyzing python code to infer the types of regular python programs to find bugs and generate documentation.

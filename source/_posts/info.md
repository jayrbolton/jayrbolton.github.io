I work and live in Berkeley and Oakland, went to college in Olympia and Santa Fe, and grew up in Albuquerque.

I like increasing the ratio of effectiveness to complexity, the relationship of syntax and semantics, considering the gap between subject and object, and snacks.

I like to use Debian, Vim, xmonad, Tmux, and the colemak keyboard layout.

I built this site using [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and based it originally on the [apollo](https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo) theme.

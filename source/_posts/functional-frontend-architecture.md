Frontend dev is a wild beast that runs amok, devouring villagers, elusive to control and obedience. With complex UI, it's easy to get trapped in a mess of globals, side effects, ill-defined control flow, and lack of modularity. Recent developments from the functional programming community in the Virtual DOM (treating your markup as regular javascript data structures, to be produced by regular functions), and Functional Reactive Programming (abstracting your asynchronous UI events as well-defined data structures), plus package management and modules, finally allows us to create well-organized UI modules that can be composed, extended, and tested with ease.

This approach is inspired by [The Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial), but is catered to those who would rather leverage plain JS modules on npm. It is also inspired by [@paldepind](https://github.com/paldepind/functional-frontend-architecture)'s architecture, but modified to be simpler.

To see an overview of this approach, this repo serves as the ongoing documentation and example collection for the architecture: [https://github.com/jayrbolton/functional-frontend-architecture](https://github.com/jayrbolton/functional-frontend-architecture)
